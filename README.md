# Battery Thermal Management System for Electric Vehicles

This project simulates and optimizes a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) for electric vehicles using Python. It models the thermal dynamics of a battery pack with multiple cells, simulates temperature distribution under various operating conditions, and optimizes cooling strategies to maintain safe temperatures.

## Key Features:
- **Thermal Modeling**: Mathematical modeling of battery cell temperature dynamics.
- **Simulation**: Simulation of temperature distribution over time considering charging/discharging currents.
- **Optimization**: Optimization of cooling power profiles to minimize peak temperatures.
- **Visualization**: Visualization of temperature profiles using matplotlib.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/Battery-Thermal-Management.git`
- Run simulations: Execute `python BatteryThermalManagement.py`
- Explore optimization results: View optimized temperature profiles in graphs.

## Dependencies:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and array operations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting temperature profiles over time.
- `scipy`: For numerical optimization algorithms (`minimize` function).

This project is aimed at understanding and improving the thermal management of batteries in electric vehicles, contributing to safer and more efficient energy storage solutions.
